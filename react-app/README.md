# react-learn
- We can use css files in react in multiple ways
    - define it in the index.html (using `link rel='stylesheet'...`)
    - importing it in the react js file directly (`import './test.css';`)
        - Only css files within the 'src/' folder can be imported in these cases. Relative imports outside of 'src/' are not supported.
