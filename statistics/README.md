- Assume that an event E is dependent on observation F. Further assume that the chances of occurrence of E are x/z and the chances of E not occurring are y/z. The ratio of these two, i.e. x/y is termed as the **Prior Ratio**. Also, assume that he probability of the observation F when E occurs is a/c and the probability of observation F when E does not occur is b/c. Then the probability of the observation in case the event E occurs divided by the probability of the observation in case E does not occur is called the **Likelihood Ratio** (a/b). The odds of event E occurring given F is called **Posterior Ratio** and is calculated as `Posterior Ratio = Likelihood Ratio * Prior Ratio` (ax/by). The probability of event E occurring given F can then be calculated as `ax/(ax + by)`
